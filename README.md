- 👋 Hi, I’m @gitrustyw
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Github and new forms of programming.  I've been a product manager, marketing manager, biz dev person etc so I'm not well versed in coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, but hoping that new services like Replit and Bolt will provide me a path to create prototypes and simple apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to real-time text-to-voice and video applidcations. 
- 📫 How to reach me rusty at answerstage.com or rusty @ formingthefuture.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play drums, piano, guitar and write and record music. I've experimented with AI music and find it fascinating and extremely discouraging at the same time.  Some of what I've created with it is very good.
